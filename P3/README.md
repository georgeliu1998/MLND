#Creating Customer Segmentations with Unsupervised Learning Techniques

In this project, we aim to use unsupervised learning techniques to help our client, a wholesale grocery distributor, 
to identify different customer segments in order to better understand customer behaviors and devise corresponding marketing strategy and
operational plan to better meet customersâ€™ needs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and 
Gaussian Mixture Model clustering (GMM) techniques are explored and final customer segmentations are recommended.
